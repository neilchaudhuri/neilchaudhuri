## Hey <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">, I'm [Neil](https://twitter.com/RealNeilC).

I am the President of [Vidya](https://www.vidyasource.com/). I work as an architect and engineer who helps you build better software. I've been in the game for a while, and I've learned a lot. I teach [courses](https://www.vidyasource.com/courses) that dispense with theory (although I admit I enjoy theory) and help you succeed at work.

The problem is I have infinitely more to learn every day. It's fun though!

- ✈️ I am available for remote [consulting](https://www.vidyasource.com/consulting).
- 📫 I [blog](https://www.vidyasource.com/blog) about a wide range of tech topics for engineers and product managers but also for anyone who wants to think about how technology impacts our lives.

## Promoting Diversity in Tech

At Vidya, we are a passionate advocate for diversity in technology. Prejudice against anyone on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, orientation, ability, or even academic background not only limits our individual growth but also limits the creative energy necessary to develop the best software.
